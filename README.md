# Smart-assistance-for-deaf-and-dumb
A Smart Assistant for Deaf and Dumb People that bridges communication gaps using a hybrid approach. Combines a flex sensor glove with ESP32 and a vision-based system (MediaPipe + CNN) to recognize hand gestures (Aâ€“Z) and convert them into text and speech in real time, enabling inclusive, affordable, and user-friendly interaction.
